				<p>Free trading refers to $0 commissions for T3 Securities, Inc. Financial self-directed individual cash brokerage accounts that trade U.S. listed securities via mobile devices. Relevant SEC & FINRA fees may apply. Please see our Commission and Fee Schedule.</p>
				<p>T3 Securities, Inc. is currently registered in the following Jurisdictions. This is not an offer, solicitation of an offer, or advice to buy or sell securities, or open a brokerage account in any jurisdiction where T3 Securities, Inc. is not registered.</p>
				<p>All investments involve risk and the past performance of a security, or financial product does not guarantee future results or returns. Keep in mind that while diversification may help spread risk it does not assure a profit, or protect against loss, in a down market. There is always the potential of losing money when you invest in securities, or other financial products. Investors should consider their investment objectives and risks carefully before investing.</p>
				<p>Investors should be aware that system response, execution price, speed, liquidity, market data, and account access times are affected by many factors, including market volatility, size and type of order, market conditions, system performance, and other factors. These risks are to be assumed by the customer.  For additional information on data provided within the App, please see our Data Disclosure.</p>
				<p>Investors should consider the investment objectives and unique risk profile of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) carefully before investing. ETFs are subject to risks similar to those of other diversified portfolios. Leveraged and Inverse ETFs may not be suitable for all investors and may increase exposure to volatility through the use of leverage, short sales of securities, derivatives and other complex investment strategies.</p>
				<p>Although ETFs are designed to provide investment results that generally correspond to the performance of their respective underlying indices, they may not be able to exactly replicate the performance of the indices because of expenses and other factors. A prospectus contains this and other information about the ETF and should be read carefully before investing. Customers should obtain prospectuses from issuers and/or their third party agents who distribute and make prospectuses available for review. ETFs are required to distribute portfolio gains to shareholders at year end. These gains may be generated by portfolio rebalancing or the need to meet diversification requirements. ETF trading will also generate tax consequences. Additional regulatory guidance on Exchange Traded Products can be found by clicking <a href="https://www.sec.gov/investor/alerts/etfs.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
